      <h2>I am a woman who is learning how to code.</h2>
      <p>I like baseball, Dungeons and Dragons, fat cats, and white leather bags.
      <p>My personal mission is to do good things and have fun;
      help others do good things and have fun;
      and learn from and collaborate with kind, smart, and interesting people.</p>
      <p>You can find my tweeting in the internet scrum, taking boring pictures of my usually
      unadventurous and sometimes adventurous life; and flailing and thrashing in code.</p>
